\section intro Introduction
 This is the NAT Library.  It allows a program to find the external IP and port
 address of a socket.


\section description Description

	Definitions:
 
	- Game Port: The port that the game wants to find the external address of.
	- External Address: The Internet IP address and port of the game port.
 
	Getting started:
	- The game must only use UDP for its game communication.  You can't tunnel NATs
		using TCP.
	- The game must have a function that will send a buffer of data as a 
		UDP packet from the game port. See the callback ::GSNAT_SendMessageCB.
	- The game must have a function that this library can call, that will inform
		the game of the game ports's external address. See the callback 
		::GSNAT_RequestFinishedCB.
 
	Using the library:
	- The game calls GSNAT_Initialize().  If it fails the connection to the NAT
		Server could not be established.  Try a different NAT Server.
	- Continue calling GSNAT_Engine() in order to process the requests and keep
		the requested external addresses alive.
	- Call GSNAT_RequestNATAddress() to request the external address of a game
		port.  Mulitple game ports can have their external addresses reqested at
		once, but only one request per game port can be sent.
	- The ::GSNAT_RequestFinishedCB callback will inform the game of requested
		Game ports external address.
		
	Distributing the external address:
	- The Game Server must distribute its external address to all the Game
		Clients.  This can be done using the vpData parameter of
		LobbySend_CreateRoom() in gs-sdk-base SDK or pstGroupInfo paramter of
		RegServerSend_RegisterServerOnLobby() in the gs-sdk-regserver SDK.
	-	The Game Client will now get the Game Server's external address with the
 		CBLobbyRcv_NewRoom callback in gs-sdk-base or MSClient_GameServerCB in 
		gs-sdk-msclient.
	-	The Game Client must distribute its external address to the Game Server.
		This can be done using LobbySend_SetPlayerInfo() in the gs-sdk-base SDK.
	-	The Game Server will now get the Game Client's external address in the
		CBLobbyRcv_MemberJoined callback of gs-sdk-base or the
		CBRegServerRcv_LobbyServerMemberNew callback of gs-sdk-regserver
		
	Tunneling the NAT:
	- Now that the Game Server and Game Client know each others external address
		they must start sending "connection" messages to each others external
		address from their game ports.  When both sides receive a connection message
		their NATs have been tunneled.
	- This means that a Game Server must start sending messages to a Game Client
		before it has received any messages from it.  If it doesn't, its NAT may not
		allow message from the Game Client to reach it.
		
	Problems with NATs:
	- This won't work with all NATs.  Some open up a different external address
		for every endpoint.  This means that the external address when sending
		messages to the game server will be different then the external address that
		was opened when sending messages to NAT server.  Most NATs don't do this so
		most will behave properly.
	- If both NATs don't behave properly their is nothing a game can do.  The user
		will have to setup port forwarding on the Game Server.
	- If only one of the NATs is behaving properly the Game behind it will notice
		that it is receiving connection messages from a different port then the one
		it is sending its connection messages to.  For example, it is sending
		connection messages to 1.1.1.1:1200 but it is receving connection messages
		from 1.1.1.1:1300.  The Game on the other side is not receiving any
		messages.  When this is noticed it should stop sending messages to port 1200
		and switch to port 1300.  The other side should now start receiving them.
