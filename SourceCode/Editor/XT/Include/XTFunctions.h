// Summary: This member function will initialize the resources for the Xtreme Toolkit.
//			If using the Xtreme Toolkit as an extension DLL within a regular DLL,
//			add the following two lines to your stdafx.h file. This will give you
//			access to the exported function InitXtremeExtDll():
// 
//			<pre>#define XT_INIT_BY_REGULAR_DLL
//			#include "XTToolkit.h"</pre>
// 
//			You will then need to add XT_INIT_BY_REGULAR_DLL to the Xtreme Toolkit 
//			preprocessor definitions and rebuild it.  After you have done this
//			locate your CWinApp::InitInstance() method for your regular DLL and make
//			the following call:
// 
//			<pre>InitXtremeExtDLL();</pre>
// 
//			This will initialize the resources for the Xtreme Toolkit.
