<h1>Simplifying MacOS Blitting with BinkBuffers</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>So, which method should you use? Direct-to-screen or GWorlds? To help with this dilemma, Bink includes the BinkBuffer API. BinkBuffers hide a bunch of the MacOS weirdness to make switching between these options really easy. The example Bink Player for MacOS uses the BinkBuffer API to make displaying Bink frames simple. Note, however, that the BinkBuffer API is a high-level API, so if you've already got a good blitting solution in your application, you may simply want to skip BinkBuffers completely and have Bink just copy directly into your linear buffers (which could be on-screen, in a GWorld, or in your own format). </p>
