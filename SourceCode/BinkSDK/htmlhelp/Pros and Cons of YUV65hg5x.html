<h1>Pros and Cons of YUV Overlays under Win32</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p><b>YUV Overlays are good, because:</b> 1) They are super-fast (you don't blit them to the screen, you just draw onto the surface and the pixels appear). 2) They have clipping built-in. 3) They float above your application, so they don't disturb anything in your application. 4) They can do shrinking and stretching for free, CPU-wise. <br> <b>YUV overlays are bad, because:</b> 1) They are hardware (so you are at the mercy of the video card and video card DirectDraw drivers). 2) They can look different on different video cards (especially when stretching). 3) They float above your application, so it's hard to make them seem completely integrated into your application. 4) They are usually disabled when Direct3D is running. </p>
