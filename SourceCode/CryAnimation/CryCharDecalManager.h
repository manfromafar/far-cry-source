// This class manages decals on characters.
// It memorizes requests for decals, then realizes them using the character skin
// geometry (constructs the decal face strip, UV-maps it)
//
// The workflow is as follows:
//   Request(Add) the decal. At this stage, its info will just be memorized, it won't be present in the decal list
//   Realize the decal. At this stage, the deformable geometry will be created for the decal.
//   Render the decal. After realization, the decals have their own geometry that bases on the deformed vertices
//   and normals of the character skin.
